## Problem Statement

In SHG (Self Help Group) lending, loans are typically sanctioned in a Cash Credit (CC) structure but repayments are collected in an EMI-based manner.

An SHG usually consists of 10 or more members. Each member withdraws different loan amounts at different times, repays for a few months, may miss instalments, and may withdraw again from the same loan limit.

This creates multiple challenges for bankers:
- Difficulty in identifying the correct outstanding principal
- Errors in EMI recalculation after fresh withdrawals
- Manual and time-consuming calculations at branch level
- Lack of transparency when explaining loan status to SHG members

Traditional EMI calculators fail to address these realities.

This project aims to solve this exact operational problem using Excel.
